He attended Cardinal Dougherty High School in Philadelphia &#91; where he was born and grew up in &#93;. He played there through grade 9-12 as a point guard. He was considered a five star recruit by local scouts, who watched his games. In 2004, he was assessed and named the 6th best point guard of America, and 28th best player overall &#91; in his age group of course &#93;. Impressed with his ranking, Villanova university &#91; also in philadelphia &#93; recruited Lowry to join their team in the Big East league. Over there he played two years of college basketball. In his first year he did not perform to expectation, as he only averaged 7.5 points a game, shot 42 percent from inside the line, and shot 27 percent from the three point line.

Lowry put up decent numbers in his debut getting 6 points&sbquo; 10 rebounds&sbquo; 3 assists&sbquo; two steals&sbquo; and even a shot block&#33; Fans were happy as they felt Lowry would be a big contributor to the team’s success that year. However ten games into the season Lowry would suffer a season ending broken wrist injury. Fortunately his surgery went successful and he was cleared to play in the next season.
